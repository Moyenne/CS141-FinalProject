List of Known Bugs
------------------
(remove these from the list once they are resolved)

format: [description] ; [way to reproduce the bug]

- when the user enters debug mode after looking in some direction, exiting debug mode will result in the 'looked at' square turning invisible instead of visible ; look in some direction, enter debug with "tdm404", exit debug with "tdm404"

- when the user looks in some direction and then tries to load a file that contains a state of the game where they are able to look in some direction, they are not given the option ; save a state of the game where you have the 'look' option, look in some direction, load the file that you just saved
